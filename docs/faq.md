**1. Why not verify on ChatTriggers?**

The module was getting too large and I did not want to annoy them with verifying it. You can still use the version on ChatTriggers, but I just won't be updating that one.


**2. LF Rats**

There will not be any rats (I think), but I am as trustworthy as the next person so take that what you will.


**3. Setup did not work**

- Check if you placed correct folder in correct location. Run `/ct files`, click modules, click VolcAddons, and verify you see multiple files and folders.

- Make sure you are using ChatTriggers v2.2.0

- Run `/ct console js` and if there is red text please DM `grapefruited` on Discord


**4. "Missing arguments! Usage: /viewauction <auction id>"**

- Another mod is turn `/va` into a shortcut for `/viewauction`. You should still be able to use `/volc`.


**5. Where do I report bugs or suggest features**

Please open a thread on the VolcAddons Discord server: [here](https://discord.gg/ftxB4kG2tw)
