### <u>Before Installation:</u>
1. **Install Forge:** Ensure that you have [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.9.html) installed to enable mod compatibility.

2. **Install ChatTriggers:** You'll need [ChatTriggers](https://www.chattriggers.com) installed for advanced in-game functionality.

3. **Choices:** Choose one of the two options below to follow.


### <u>Forge Installation:</u>
1. **Download:** Download the [VolcAddons-1.0.jar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhenga8533/VolcAddons/main/forge/VolcAddons-1.0.jar) file.

2. **Integration:** Drag into Minecraft mods folder (NOT the CT modules folder).

3. **El Fin v1:** You should be good to go! The mod will alert you if there is ever a new release in which you can just run `/updateva`!


### <u>Manual Installation:</u>
1. **Download:** Get the zip file, available either on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ftxB4kG2tw) or through [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/zhenga8533/VolcAddons/releases).

2. **Unzip:** Extract the downloaded zip file. You should now see a folder named "VolcAddons".

3. **Accessing ChatTriggers:** Launch Minecraft and enter the command `/ct files` (you can also find this by going into ChatTriggers through the Minecraft configs path)

4. **Integration:** Return to the unzipped folder.

5. **Module Replacement:** Drag the VolcAddons folder into the "modules" folder.

6. **Confirmation:** If a pop-up appears, select "replace".

7. **El Fin v2:** Now just type `/ct load` and your job is done!
